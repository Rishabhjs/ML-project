Introduction
This program applies basic machine learning (classification) concepts on Fisher's Iris Data to predict the species of a new sample of Iris flower. The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two. This means that we can draw a line between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species.

Predicted Attribute: Different Species of Iris plant.

Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):
1) Length of the sepals
2) Width of the sepals
3) Length of the petals
4) Width of the petals

Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain introductory to ML Classification concepts with data visualization. The project makes a very much usage of Data Visualization Libraries, Scikit-Learn & Pandas.
