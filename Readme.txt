Introduction
This program applies basic machine learning (classification) concepts on Fisher's Iris Data to predict the species of a new sample of Iris flower. The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):
1) Length of the sepals
2) Width of the sepals
3) Length of the petals
4) Width of the petals
